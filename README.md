# GovCMS Consultation module

AKA: Have your say

## Status

This module is originally developed by Dept Communications DOCA)
and is roadmapped for the D8 GovCMS distribution. Being updated
courtesy of the Aust Communications Media Authority (ACMA).

There are outstanding issues and TODOs  with it:

1. Currently *not fit* for private submissions.

2. Conflicts with field_group beta1 that GovCMS has, works
with latest dev version.

3. Very cursory theming treatment to match the d7 published version
of the module and DOCAs visual theming. That means you would
need to theme it for your own site.

4. D7 was able to generate "public submissions" with views, but in 
D8 the this feature moved to webform_views. Currently there
is a fairly rough block plugin to do the same thing, but
one would argue that it should be a view, so left rough.

5. There are some features not covered yet but generally the node
and webform structure is all in place.
